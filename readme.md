# Predicting Hand Sign (Rock - Paper - Scissors)

</center>

## Objective

The goal is to predict hand sign when playing rock paper scissors. We'll use convolutional neural networks (CNN) to train the model, and we'll transform the image in the dataset to only show the edge of the hand. (as shown in the picture in below)

## Dataset Information

The dataset is gained from kaggle, uploaded by [drgfreeman](https://github.com/DrGFreeman/rps-cv) to kaggle. You can access the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/drgfreeman/rockpaperscissors/data)
